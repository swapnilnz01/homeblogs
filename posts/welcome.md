# Welcome to HomeBlog

This is your first blog post! You can write posts in Markdown and they'll be automatically displayed on your blog.

## How it works

- Posts are stored in the `posts/` directory as Markdown files
- Each file needs frontmatter with `title`, `date`, and `excerpt`
- The blog automatically picks up new posts and displays them in reverse chronological order

## Next steps

1. Create new `.md` files in the `posts/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with post metadata
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Your blog will automatically update!

Happy blogging! 📝
